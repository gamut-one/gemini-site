# Gamut One

Gamut One is a hosting service for the "small web", offering HTTPS, Gopher, and Gemini hosting with 200MB storage. Access is currently limited to sftp only, but in the near future we'll provide a limited telnet BBS experience for account management and community tools.

This site is also available via other protocols:

=> https://gamut.one HTTPS
=> gopher://gamut.one Gopher
=> gemini://gamut.one Gemini
